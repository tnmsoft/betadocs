# New Features

* You can now specify a page field for Cross Tab reports.

* When you rename a report, any custom file names stored with the export options for that report are now cleared.

* You can now set a duration for the repeat interval of a scheduled task.

* A user with a Report Viewer license can now edit the filter conditions of a report. 

* If a schedule fails because one of the reports didn't match any records, we now display a more specific error message about this.

* When sending emails using the credentials of an Administrator account, email address of the user account is now used as the From address. This allows an email service like SendGrid to send from a previously verified domain.

* A new report management interface is available under the tools menu. This allows you to change the roles or tenant setting for multiple reports at the same time. You can also delete multiple reports using this interface, rather than having to delete them one at a time.

* Fields with a display expression can now be output to the Excel Data Only format. 

* Chart reports now automatically switch to landscape if the width of the chart exceeds the width of the page in portrait.

* Dynamic tables for SQL Passthrough reports should no longer appear in the available tables list.

* Fixed a bug whre a tag with subtags wasn't visible, even if it had relevant reports.
